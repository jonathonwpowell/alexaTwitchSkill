I retain the right to save any commands you send to the app for the purpose of improving the app.
  For exaple if you say "Alexa ask my twitch streams who is streaming minecraft" I will save this
  
I will not store any data that allows me to access your twitch account or to identify your twitch account
  (the only thing I have access to is a token that allows me to read data about your twitch account, and I won't save it)

If you link your twitch account, you give me user_read & user_subscriptions permission (find the definitions here: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/v5/guides/authentication/#Scopes)

I will not store any data that allows me to identify you
